                <h2>Data Analytics Intern</h2>
                <h3>June 2023 - Sept. 2023<br>Pacific Life</h3>
                <p>Under the Marketing Analytics team, I created three major projects during the course of the internship.
                    My major project was a Reach, Cost, Quality (RCQ) Model, which compared marketing channels across metrics
                    that were measured differently amongst channels. My two other projects were built in Tableau, with one consisting
                    of a plot showing common metrics in a single marketing campaign and the other being an interactive calculator to project marketing leads.

                <h2>Tutor</h2>
                <h3>Sept. 2022 - June 2023<br>Penzils</h3>
                <p>Working for a startup that aimed to provide fast tutoring services to elementary and secondary school students,
                    I often created lesson plans, synthesizing requests from school staff and the students who were ages 6-10. Here, I learned
                    how to respond to both positive and negative feedback and find solutions to benefit all parties involve while engaging primary audiences.

                <h3>Nov. 2020 - Jan. 2023<br>Plato's Closet</h3>
                <p>My roles at Plato's Closet trained me for staying on top of the trend cycle and external affairs.
                    Here, we obtained our inventory directly from guests wanting to sell their clothing.
                    Starting here while the pandemic was waning, I quickly navigated an environment that promoted efficient yet diligent work.
                    As we looked to buy gently used clothing, I emphasized the importance of attention to detail and high standards of quality inspection.

                <h2>Reader,<br>Learning Assistant</h2>
                <h3>March 2022 - Dec. 2022<br>University of California, Irvine</h3>
                <p>I started off as a Learning Assistant for the ICS 6D Discrete Mathematics course
                    taught by Professor Irene Gassko. During this time, I hosted weekly office hours,
                    attended weekly lectures to aid students with group exercises, and earned a Certified Learning Assistant
                    certificate. After my initial quarter, I was invited back to
                    be a Reader for the ICS 6B Boolean Algebra & Logic course. This quarter, we implemented specification grading,
                    where we gauged whether students met a specific course learning outcome, rather than awarding arbitrary points.
