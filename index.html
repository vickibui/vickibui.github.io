                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspWelcome to my portfolio!
                I designed this website using Visual Studio Code and Github Pages.
                Here, you can have an in-depth look at some of the projects I have been most proud of
                in both my academic and professional career.
                My journey started in 2020 as a Criminology, Law, & Society major and Personal Shopper at Plato's Closet. 
                From there, I switched into Data Science as my major and left CLS as my minor while also picking up the Global Sustainability minor.
                As I professionally advanced, I gained experience as a Learning Assistant, then a Reader, for the UCI ICS Department. From there, I 
                completed a summer internship at Fortune 500 company Pacific Life, and am now currently working as a Data Visualization Developer at
                Boundary Remote Sensing Systems. 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspMy educational background has allowed me to take on a specialized skillset that can be
                transferred to a variety of fields. 
                I enjoy using analytical and mathmatical skills from my data science background to understand and find solutions for problems associated
                with environmental concerns or legal and governmental matters. 
                My portfolio is still in progress, as it is being built by myself
                without using a website builder, but my contact information is included for further questions!
